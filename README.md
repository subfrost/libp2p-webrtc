# libp2p-webrtc
**NOTE: webrtc support has been added to rust-libp2p. browser-to-browser is not
yet supported. This crate will stay as-is and not receive any maintenance
efforts anymore.**

WebRTC transport for rust-libp2p for both native and WebAssembly (browser). For
initiating a connection between two peers, both of them need to connect to the
same WebSocket signaling server (via a call to `listen_on`). Either one can dial
the other peer by using the `p2p-webrtc-star` protocol. Note, that this crate is
currently not interoperable with the respective js-libp2p and go-libp2p
implementations.

Additional, a signaling server implementation is provided within the crate.

## Quickstart

To compile this crate, you need `gcc g++ libssl-dev make cmake clang
pkg-config`.

```rust
let base_transport = WebRtcTransport::new(peer_id, vec!["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"]);
let transport = base_transport.upgrade()...

..

swarm
    .listen_on(
        "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8001/ws/p2p-webrtc-star"
            .parse()
            .unwrap(),
    )
    .unwrap();
```
